Methodology for Financial Indexing.

We want this indexing to make sense upon first read, and be repeatable by anyone.
Here is the approach. Core principles, followed by detailed methodology.

# Core Principles

1. Self-contained calculations using only publicly available data
2. Clear boundaries that anyone can understand
3. Repeatable methodology without subjective input
4. Transparent weighting that makes intuitive sense

# Boundary Method

Let's use a percentile-based approach to create boundaries for the indexing.
- Min Val = 10th Percentile of all companies in a particlar dataset
- Max Val = 90th Percentile of all companies in a dataset.
- Everything below 10th percentile scores 0
- Everything above 90th percentile scores 1
This prevents outliers skewing the dataset too much.

## Boundary Documentation
Clearly document actual boundaries used for indexing.
Update boundaries on a fixed schedule (probaly quarterly).
Publish raw data.

# Metric Selection

We can condense the metrics into 4 attributes that are easy to understand, and allow users to focus indexing weights as they wish through governance.
This means that governance allows users to vote on how important each attribute should be.

- Profitability (30%)
- Stability (30%)
- Growth/Revenue (20%)
- Efficiency (20%)
