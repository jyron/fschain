## 4. Data Processing

### 4.1 Financial Data Processing

#### 4.1.1 Key Metrics for F-Token Valuation
- Quarterly Earnings (EPS)
- Revenue Growth Rate (YoY%)
- Profit Margins (Gross, Operating, Net)
- Debt-to-Equity Ratio
- Free Cash Flow
- Return on Assets/Equity
- P/E Ratio (relative to sector)
- Analyst Consensus (weighted by accuracy history)

#### 4.1.2 Financial Index Formula (Preliminary)
```
F-Index = (0.30 * Earnings_Score) + 
          (0.20 * Growth_Score) + 
          (0.15 * Profitability_Score) + 
          (0.15 * Stability_Score) + 
          (0.10 * Analyst_Score) + 
          (0.10 * Relative_Valuation_Score)
```
Each component score is normalized to a 0-100 scale.

### 4.2 Sentiment Data Processing

#### 4.2.1 Key Metrics for S-Token Valuation
- Social Media Sentiment (weighted by platform relevance)
- Social Media Engagement (likes, shares, comments)
- News Coverage Volume
- News Sentiment Analysis
- Search Interest Trends
- Meme/Viral Content Analysis
- Celebrity/Influencer Mentions
- Product Launch Reception

#### 4.2.2 Sentiment Index Formula (Preliminary)
```
S-Index = (0.35 * Social_Media_Score) + 
          (0.25 * News_Media_Score) + 
          (0.20 * Search_Trend_Score) + 
          (0.15 * Brand_Perception_Score) +
