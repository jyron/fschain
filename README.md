# FS CHAIN

**FS Chain** is a dual-token protocol designed to decouple the financial and sentiment-based value components of publicly known companies. By introducing two synthetic assets—**F-Coin** (financial) and **S-Coin** (sentiment)—FS Chain provides a more granular, transparent, and expressive framework for understanding and investing in corporate value.

## 🌐 Overview

FS Chain redefines how market participants interact with company value:

- **F-Coin** reflects quantifiable financial performance metrics (e.g. earnings, revenue, margins).
- **S-Coin** tracks sentiment-driven market dynamics (e.g. media coverage, social discourse, public narrative).

The protocol allows users to mint, hold, and trade either token independently, enabling tailored exposure to different drivers of market behavior.
